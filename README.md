# Health Monitoring System using Telegram Bot and Website

This project is a real-time Health Monitoring System that uses IoT sensors to track patient vitals and send alerts through a Telegram bot, while also displaying data on a responsive web interface. It provides a user-friendly platform for remote health supervision, especially useful for elderly care, hospitals, and home-based patient monitoring.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time monitoring of vital parameters (e.g., Heart Rate, Temperature, SpO2)
- Alerts and notifications via **Telegram Bot**
- Live data visualization on a **web dashboard**
- Remote access to health data from anywhere
- IoT integration using ESP32/Arduino
- Firebase/MQTT/ThingSpeak/HTTP (based on your implementation)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** ESP32 / Arduino, Sensors (LM35, MAX30100, etc.)
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Telegram Bot API
- **Backend:** Firebase / ThingSpeak / Node.js (if used)
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi (HTTP / MQTT)
- **Platform:** Telegram, Web Browser
